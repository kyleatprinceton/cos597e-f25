# Advanced Topics in Computer Science- Recent Advances in Wireless Networks
{:.no_toc}

![xkcd cartoon](assets/images/wifi_vs_cellular_2x_r_i_t.gif){:width="65%"}

This graduate seminar will explore selected topics in wireless
networks drawn from the recent research literature and industry. The
approach is interdisciplinary and cross-layer, covering applications
and end-to-end transport protocols, as well as physical- and
link-layer design, aiming to gain an understanding of how their
interactions influence performance. Areas of interest will include
machine learning-based wireless channel modeling, 5G and Open RAN
network architecture, computational structures for physical-layer
processing, millimeter-wave reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, and
congestion control/queue management.
