# Research Paper Presentations

A major component of this seminar is reading and discussing research
papers during our meetings.  To kick this discussion off, a
participant will present the paper being discussed in PowerPoint
slides at the beginning of the session.

Presentations should be 30-45 minutes, and cover the paper in depth,
i.e., not only the high-level framing, but also the detailed system
design, implementation, evaluation, related work, and if applicable,
impact on the field.

Presenters should also come prepared with questions and ideas to seed
the discussion, both based on their own thoughts, and also based on
questions/feedback from the class on Perusall (available by the
day-before 11:59 PM deadline).  The end of your presentation should
contain an "opinion part," followed by an interactive "deep dive" into
the discussion threads accumulated over the week on Perusall.

Non-presenters should come prepared to actively participate in the
discussion, and should have read the paper in detail prior to class
and contributed to the Perusall discussion.

By 11:59 PM ET the day before meeting, presenters should email their
slides to the instructor for grading and inclusion on the website.
