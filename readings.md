# Research Paper Readings and Discussion

A major component of this course is reading and discussing research
papers during meetings. To ensure a lively and focused discussion, you
should closely read each paper and add comments and questions on
Perusall.

{: .assignment}
Please provide five to 10 substantive comments (some could be in
thread replies) for each paper and follow comments from other students
and the instructor, **by 11:59 PM ET Thursday** before the
corresponding meeting.

This seminar requires your full participation. Complete all assigned
readings before class and come to class on time, prepared with
comments and questions. Class participation will be evaluated by the
overall quality of your contributions, which includes attendance and
listening as well as speaking. You are expected to contribute to a
classroom atmosphere of mutual respect and productivity. Each
unexplained absence will result in a one-third of a letter grade
reduction (e.g. from an A to an A-, and so on) in your participation
grade.

COS 597S will use the following criteria, as judged by the instructor
(who will also participate in discussions) for the paper discussion
component of your class participation grade:

- Contributing thoughtful questions and comments to the class
  discussion before the Wednesday 11:59 PM deadline
- Posing thoughtful questions and comments that elicit responses from
  classmates
- Answering questions from others
- Upvoting thoughtful questions and helpful answers

{: .assignment}
Please come to each meeting prepared with the following points
that will substantially contribute to the group discussion.

- What problem is the paper solving and why is that problem important?
- What was the previous state of the art and how does this paper
  advance that state of the art?
- How does the protocol, design, or system work?
- What are the key insights in the design that enabled it to advance
  the state of the art?
- How is the design implemented and evaluated and what are the key
  results?
- What related problems are still open and is the problem fully
  solved?

Your seminar participation grade will be determined based on
attendance and, more importantly, substantial contributions to paper
discussions both on Perusall and in person.
