# COS 597S: Advanced Topics in Computer Science- Recent Advances in Wireless Networks

This graduate seminar will explore selected topics in wireless networks drawn from the recent research literature and industry. The approach is interdisciplinary and cross-layer, covering applications and end-to-end transport protocols, as well as physical- and link-layer design, aiming to gain an understanding of how their interactions influence performance. Areas of interest will include machine learning-based wireless channel modeling, 5G and Open RAN network architecture, computational structures for physical-layer processing, millimeter-wave reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, and congestion control/queue management.
